#Feature: ScrollView Component Validation

#    As a Beagle developer/user
#    I'd like to make sure my scrollView component works as expected
#    In order to guarantee that my application never fails


#    Scenario: ScrollView 01 - scrollView component renders text attribute correctly
#        Given the app did load scrollview screen
#        Then scrollview screen should render all text attributes correctly

#    Scenario: ScrollView 02 - scrollView component performs vertical scroll correctly
#        Given the app did load scrollview screen
#        When I have a vertical scroll configured
#        Then scrollview screen should perform the scroll action vertically

#    Scenario: ScrollView 03 - scrollView component performs horizontal scroll correctly
#        Given the app did load scrollview screen
#        When I have a horizontal scroll configured
#        Then scrollview screen should perform the scroll action horizontally
